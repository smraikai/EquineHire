Working at Augusta is an experience unlike any other. Our days are beautiful, demanding, inspiring, educational, hilarious, frustrating, silly, surprising, intimate, active and most importantly, full of opportunity. Our staff have ample opportunities to develop themselves personally and professionally. In our 3.5 week staff training and throughout the summer, staff can learn and practice progressive models of child development and counseling, communication techniques like clean communication and Nonviolent Communication, diverse leadership styles as well as how to live in a tight-knit community. Come with an open-mind, a trusting-heart and plenty of ambition, and leave with a soul on fire!</p>
<p>We are a residential summer camp that offers six sessions (3 week-long and 3 two week-long) playing in the sun with 90 campers each session. We are committed to fostering the innocence and imagination of childhood, and we aim to give campers time away from the distractions of modern life. From sleeping in open air cabins without electricity to replacing television and radio with camp songs and campfire skits, we give campers the opportunity to reconnect with the beauty and simplicity of nature.</p>
<p>Augusta stands proudly and equally on two pillars: play and personal growth. Play is the heart of our summer camp experience. Where camper’s dreams meet counselor’s know-how, Augusta breathes magic into every day. And just as important as the spirit of play, personal growth underpins every aspect of life at camp. Engaging deeply with our intentional community, both campers and staff have the opportunity to develop self-awareness, confidence, creativity, healthy ways of communicating and so much more!</p>

<p>So if you hate learning, don't come here. If you loathe being paid on time, and having beautiful on-site accommodations, we're not for you.

<p>Our dream candidate comes with dressage experience at or above Third Level, and/or with young horses. Our full-training facility keeps 20 horses and their owners happy, healthy and advancing, and brings both horses and riders up the levels to FEI in a positive and compassionate way. We also bring in world-class clinicians, travel to shows, winter in Florida, and teach and learn together. Dark humor is our love language. And there's often snacks.</p>
<p>Previous team members have gone on to be trainers and stable managers in their own rights, and many have been able to earn their medals on client horses. This is a riding and stable work position, with room for growth into teaching, and includes a salary and housing.</p>
<p>So if being treated like crap is your jam, move on. But if you're a hard working, team-oriented, snack-motivated ball of fun, we want to meet you. Must be eligible to work in the US without sponsorship, and be able to lift 50 pounds. Ideally this position begins in April, though we could bring the right candidate on early.

Has your secret wish always been to teach riding, but it didn't seem like a real option? At Leg Up, the horse is the guide. We don't believe jumping higher or accumulating ribbons has any meaning if it's not accompanied by a purpose and a dream. Where do you want to go?</p>
<p>If you are looking for a life-changing career at a life-changing program, we might be the magic you have been waiting for. If you are passionate about teaching and eager for education, this program could lead to a career with us (both part and full time opportunities available). Job availability and when you are hired depends on your work ethic, mindset, and skills. If you qualify, you will join our family and become part of an exemplary approach that focuses on the art of teaching and coaching and which will give you skills not just in the ring and in the barn, but in life. Our program's emphasis is not only on hiring an instructor, it is primarily about working with special people who are looking for much more than just a job. This could be your chance for the dream job you didn't think was possible!</p>
<p>Leg Up Equestrian is seeking top candidates for our upcoming apprenticeship program beginning June 22'nd.

<p>Leg Up is an English riding academy that emphasizes horsemanship and personal growth. We specialize in dressage, jumping, cross-country jumping, and eventing.</p>
<p>But what sets us apart? • A developed, proven curriculum (our “Levels of Achievement”) that has brought success to thousands of riders of all ages, interests, and abilities. • Our emphasis on a warm, positive environment and unique working student program that teaches character and personal growth as part of horsemanship. • Our safe schoolmaster horses, our certified instructors, and our integrated barn and horse care instruction. • But mostly, what makes Leg Up so special is that our top priority is to unite our students with the magic of horses so that they can realize their dreams, find their voice, and grow.</p>

<div dir=""auto"">The Scattered Acres Fellowship is an experiential learning program focused on riding instruction and comprehensive professional development in the equine industry. We prefer our applicants have at least two years of riding and horse care experience and commit to a one-year fellowship but will consider shorter durations as well. Our curriculum and focus is calibrated for each individual depending on their experience, the duration of their commitment and their goals. All fellows are instructed in the fundamentals of equine care, barn management, riding instruction, horse training, competition grooming and equestrian business management. Intensive daily riding lessons from the founder and owner of Scattered Acres, Autumn Rae, will focus on elevating our fellows to be competent and competitive equestrians in dressage, stadium and cross country jumping. We are located in the geographic heart of eventing, dressage and hunter jumper country so there will be ample opportunities to attend and perhaps compete in local USEA, USDF, USHJA, competitions. Additional educational activities will include reading assignments, various clinics and working with our on-site non-profit HEAL which is an equine assisted learning and psychotherapy organization working to assist veterans and first responders. There is no shortage of opportunities to learn and advance here at Scattered Acres. Fellows are immediately immersed in the responsibilities of operating a busy riding stable and contribute to the efforts of our professional team. Our fellows benefit tremendously from this intensive practical experience and leave prepared for many possibilities in the equine industry. Please see our website for more information.</div>
